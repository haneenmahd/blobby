# Download
You can download these binaries from the latest [releases](https://github.com/haneenmahd/blobby/releases)

# Usage
using the cli bases exe file:
just run the `main.exe`
and it will ask for every file you want, just provide it.
If you are tired of providing every file just write `dir  <your-directory>` this will read every image from that directory

Again it will ask for output file, just give that too.
